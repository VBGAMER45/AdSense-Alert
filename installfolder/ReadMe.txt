4: How To Section
	How do I setup emailing adsnese updates to my email account?
	First you will need a website that supports PHP and has a smtp server.
	Next open up mail.php which is included in the directory of AdsenseAlert
	Edit $emailaddress and  $mailfrom to the proper information for you site.
	Next upload mail.php to your server.
	Finally Open up AdseneAlert and go to options
	Make sure Email Adsense Updates is checked
	And change the Path To PHP script to the address of where you upload mail.php
	It will email results depending each interval update. So if you plan I using this
	setting the interval pretty high, in order not to receive a ton of emails.
